# Monopoly Example

This is an example of the game “Monopoly” built with Verbs. All the rules of Monopoly
have not been implemented, but many of the basic rules are in place. It’s a good way to
see how to use Verbs with a complex set of rules and multiple states interacting at once.

In this example, there are no controllers or Livewire components. Everything is purely in
event state. In a real-world application, you would need to implement a way for users to
interact with this state—either thru traditional HTTP requests, or a REST API, or with
something like Livewire.
